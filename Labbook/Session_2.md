#Synthetic Biology Practical 2 
## 3/3/2015 
### Tasks completed during this practical:
> In Order.
1.Observe plates from yesterday. 
2.Run gel electrophoresis of the PCR that was done in the last practical.
3.Run PCR on genes of intrest using the specific primers for this experiment. LAC1-LAC6.

### Methods
#### Gel Electrophoresis
> Gel electrophoresis is done in two parts: Prep and execution.

##### Preperation
 >1. Prepare Tris-Borate EDTA gel Buffer (TBE) - 10.8g Tris base, 5.5 grams Boric Acid, 4ml of 0.5M EDTA(ph8). Dissolve in 1L of distilled water.
 2. To prep the gel, melt 1 gram of Agarose in 100ml TBE buffer in a flask.
 3. Add 1uL of cyber-Safe - this binds to the DNA in the buffer be extra cautios as it is carcegenic. 
 4. Pour the soloution onto a preped plate (has been taped up) and allow it to settel. 

##### Execution 
1. Add log ladder, if the DNA is large 2Log ladder is the best to use.
2. Usually you would add gel loading buffer - however this is not neccisary for this experiment as these have been preped with gel load buffer. 
3. Load gels making sure you know where they are.
4. Run the gel.
5. Once it has completed the run, place in the imager and apply a UV light, take image and note results.

####PCR
> Mix these reactants in  this order in a 0.2ml eppendorf tube.

1. 35.3 uL of Water.
2. 10 uL of PCR Buffer.
3. 2.5 uL of Enhancer.
4. 0.5 uL of Template.
5. 0.5 uL of primer 1.
6. 0.5 uL of Primer 2.
7. 0.5 uL of Deoxynucelotide Triphosphate (DNTP)
8. 0.5 uL of Q5 high-fidelity DNA Polymerase (1 year old.). 


### Comments 
The outcome of the gel was successful for ZRA promoter and ZRAP however was unsuccessful for the ZRAS gene - this was the largest at 2kb and we believe could have made it quite hard for the one Taq to produce viable results during PCR so as a result, this PCR done today was using a Q5 high fidelity DNA polymerase instead. Hopefully this will have worked more effectively, however we shall see. Waiting to upload images.The outcome of making competant cells was a success, The cells that had become competant uptook the plasmid containing chlorephenicaol resistance producing many colonies, where as it can be seen that the control did not produce any colonies as can be expected.
