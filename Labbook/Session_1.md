#Synthetic Biology Practical 
## 2/3/2015 
### Tasks completed during this practical:
>1. Produce Competant Cells and test by plating. 
2. Purified DNA using the Biomiga EZgene Plasmid Miniprep protocol on a e.coli strain containing pUNI-PAmCherry_eGFP also known as "pGF1 plasmid".
3. Run a PCR reactiopn to amplify the the genes that i am intrested in inserting into my plasmid. These are ZRASR ZRAP and the ZRAP-Promoter.

### Methods
####Transformation of E.coli.

####Plasmid Miniprep 
####PCR
> Mix these reactants in  this order in a 0.2ml eppendorf tube:

1. 35.3 uL of Water.
2. 10 uL of PCR Buffer.
3. 2.5 uL of Enhancer.
4. 0.5 uL of Template.
5. 0.5 uL of primer 1.
6. 0.5 uL of Primer 2.
7. 0.5 uL of Deoxynucelotide Triphosphate (DNTP)
8. 0.5 uL of Taq Polymerase (or Similar). 

### Comments.
> All the results from these expreriments will be seen tomorrow. 

#### Franks Comments
> "There is a rule in PCR: 1 Minute will run a 1000 bases.
