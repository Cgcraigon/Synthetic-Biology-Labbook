#Synthetic Biology Practical 
## 2/3/2015 
### Tasks completed during this practical:
>1. Produce Competant Cells and test by plating. 
2. Purified DNA using the Biomiga EZgene Plasmid Miniprep protocol on a e.coli strain containing pUNI-PAmCherry_eGFP also known as "pGF1 plasmid".
3. Run a PCR reactiopn to amplify the the genes that i am intrested in inserting into my plasmid. These are ZRASR ZRAP and the ZRAP-Promoter.

### Methods
####Transformation of E.coli.
>1. Thaw 100uL aliqoutof competant cells on ice.
2. Gently ix ligated DNA with 100uL of Chemically competant cells into an eppendof tube.
3. prep a control tube that only contains cells.
4. Incubate on ice for 15 mins.
5. place in 42 0c water bath for 90 seconds.
6. immediatly place on ice for at least 2 mins.
7. add 1ml of LB broth and incubate at a 37 0c water bath for 60 minutes.
8. Centrifuge the eppendorf tube at top speed for 3 mins in a centriuge.
9. Discard the supernattant by carefully pipetting it out of the tube and resuspand the cell pellet in 100uL of LB medium. 
10. Plate the whole suspension onto agar LB plates containing the appropriate antibiotic.
11. incubate at 370c overnight. 

####Plasmid Miniprep 
>1. Inoculate 5ml of LB containing the appropriate antibitic with a fresh colony. Grow at 370c for 14-16 hours with vigours shaking. 
2. Harvest the bacterial culture at 6000 rpm in a 15mL conical tube for 5 minutes. Pour off the supernatant  and blot the inverted tube on a paper towel to remove residue medium.
3. Add 450uL buffer A1 and completel resuspand bacterial pellet by vortexing or pippeting. 
4. Add 450 uL Buffer B1, mix gently by inverting 10 times(do not vortex) and incubate at room tempreture for 5 mins until the solution comes clear.

####PCR
> Mix these reactants in  this order in a 0.2ml eppendorf tube.

1. 35.3 uL of Water.
2. 10 uL of PCR Buffer.
3. 2.5 uL of Enhancer.
4. 0.5 uL of Template.
5. 0.5 uL of primer 1.
6. 0.5 uL of Primer 2.
7. 0.5 uL of Deoxynucelotide Triphosphate (DNTP)
8. 0.5 uL of Taq Polymerase (or Similar). 

### Comments.
> All the results from these expreriments will be seen tomorrow. 
> Chlorephenical resistance was added to the transformation which wasnt added to the control plate.
#### Franks Comments
> "There is a rule in PCR: 1 Minute will run a 1000 bases.
