#Synthetic Biology Practical 
## 2/3/2015 
### Tasks completed during this practical:
>1. Produce Competant Cells and test by plating. 
2. Purified DNA using the Biomiga EZgene Plasmid Miniprep protocol on a e.coli strain containing pUNI-PAmCherry_eGFP also known as "pGF1 plasmid".
3. Run a PCR reactiopn to amplify the the genes that i am intrested in inserting into my plasmid. These are ZRASR ZRAP and the ZRAP-Promoter.

### Methods
####Transformation of E.coli.
####Plasmid Miniprep 
####PCR


### Comments.
All the results from these expreriments will be seen tomorrow.
