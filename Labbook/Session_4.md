# Synthetic Biology Practical 4
## 5/3/2015 
### Tasks completed during this practical:
> 1.Run Gel of Yesterdays PCR Practical. Observe Results and decide waht else has to be done.   

> 2. Do a PCR reaction of all three genes again. This time increasing the tempreture every cycle by 0.2oc a cycle precuring 6 0C change in temp over the 30 cycles and use a new PCR polyemerase Q5 high fidelity DNA polymerase - that has just been opened.

>3. Run Gel of that PCR.

### Methods:
####PCR
> Mix these reactants in  this order in a 0.2ml eppendorf tube.

1. 35.3 uL of Water.
2. 10 uL of PCR Buffer.
3. 2.5 uL of Enhancer.
4. 0.5 uL of Template.In the case of the first PCR from the Completed Tasks section of this labbook contains only the regular E.coli template, however the second PCR reaction contains the PCR Template. 
5. 0.5 uL of primer 1.
6. 0.5 uL of Primer 2.
7. 0.5 uL of Deoxynucelotide Triphosphate (DNTP)
8. 0.5 uL of Q5 High Fidelity DNA  Polymerase (or Similar). (New bottle)

### Comments
Both gels did not work today. The first gel did not function
