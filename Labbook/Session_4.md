# Synthetic Biology Practical 4
## 5/3/2015 
### Tasks completed during this practical:
> 1.Run Gel of Yesterdays Practical. Observe Results and decide waht else has to be done.   

> 2. Do a PCR reaction of all three genes again. This time increasing the tempreture every cycle by 0.2oc a cycle precuring 6 0C change in temp over the 30 cycles. 

> 3. Do another PCR  of ZRAS using the products of PCR yesterday as a template. 

### Methods:
##### Preperation
 > 1. Prepare Tris-Borate EDTA gel Buffer (TBE) - 10.8g Tris base, 5.5 grams Boric Acid, 4ml of 0.5M EDTA(ph8). Dissolve in 1L of distilled water.
 
 > 2. To prep the gel, melt 1 gram of Agarose in 100ml TBE buffer in a flask.
 
 > 3. Add 1uL of cyber-Safe - this binds to the DNA in the buffer be extra cautios as it is carcegenic. 
 
 > 4. Pour the soloution onto a preped plate (has been taped up) and allow it to settel. 

##### Execution 
> 1. Add log ladder, if the DNA is large 2Log ladder is the best to use.

> 2. Usually you would add gel loading buffer - however this is not neccisary for this experiment as these have been preped with gel load buffer. 

> 3. Load gels making sure you know where they are.

> 4. Run the gel.

> 5. Once it has completed the run, place in the imager and apply a UV light, take image and note results.

####PCR
> Mix these reactants in  this order in a 0.2ml eppendorf tube.

1. 35.3 uL of Water.
2. 10 uL of PCR Buffer.
3. 2.5 uL of Enhancer.
4. 0.5 uL of Template.In the case of the first PCR from the Completed Tasks section of this labbook contains only the regular E.coli template, however the second PCR reaction contains the PCR Template. 
5. 0.5 uL of primer 1.
6. 0.5 uL of Primer 2.
7. 0.5 uL of Deoxynucelotide Triphosphate (DNTP)
8. 0.5 uL of Q5 High Fidelity DNA  Polymerase (or Similar). ( One Taq was used for the PCR reaction containing the PCR Template.

### Comments
The results of the gel done yesterday was more succesful than the day before as it produced a  signal for one of the ZRAS sample we were trying to isolate and amplify for later digestion, however it was very weak. So in order to boost the signal of the resulting PCR, the sample from then PCR was then used as a template for a further PCR experiment today, this should hopefully boost the signal. In conjuction with this another PCR was run hoping to improve on the result done yesterday.
